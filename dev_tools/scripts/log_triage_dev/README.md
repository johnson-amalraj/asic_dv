LogTriage is a powerful desktop application designed to help engineers and verification teams efficiently analyze, triage, and manage large volumes of simulation and compilation log files. Built with PyQt5, it provides an interactive, user-friendly interface for quickly identifying, filtering, and categorizing errors, warnings, and fatal messages from log files generated by EDA tools or similar workflows.

Key capabilities include advanced filtering and searching, multi-column sorting, exclusion management, per-row comments, summary statistics, and rich data visualizations (pie charts, timelines, heatmaps). The tool supports both plain and gzipped log files, offers robust export and session management features, and is equipped with dark mode and extensive keyboard shortcuts for productivity.

LogTriage streamlines the log review process, making it easier to focus on critical issues, collaborate with team members, and generate actionable reports from complex log data.

# Future Ideas (TODO)

    - Tagging System: Allow users to tag log entries for categorization.
    - Bulk Commenting: When adding comments, apply them to all rows with the same message.
    - Code Refactoring: Once all features are added, split the code into different files for re-use.
    - Command Line Interface (CLI): For users who prefer scripting or automation.
    - Auto-Triage Suggestions: Use simple heuristics or ML to suggest likely causes or group similar issues.
    - Integration Hooks: Allow integration with bug tracking tools (e.g., JIRA) or CI/CD pipelines.
