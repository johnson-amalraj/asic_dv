# Areas for Improvement & Suggestions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Code Structure & Maintainability

- File Size:  
  The code is very large for a single file. Consider splitting into modules:
  - `parsing.py` (log parsing, cleaning)
  - `dialogs.py` (all QDialog subclasses)
  - `main_window.py` (LogTriageWindow)
  - `worker.py` (LogParseWorker)
  - `utils.py` (utility functions)

- Class/Function Length:  
  Some methods (e.g., `init_menus`, `apply_filters`, `export_to_csv`) are very long. Break them into smaller helper functions for readability.

- Type Hints:
  Use Python type hints for function signatures to improve readability and help with static analysis.

## 2. UI/UX

- Table Performance:  
  For very large datasets, QTableWidget can be slow. Consider using `QTableView` with a custom `QAbstractTableModel` for better performance and memory efficiency.

- Filter Row Placement:  
  The filter row is implemented as a floating widget. This is clever, but can be fragile with resizing/scrolling. If you see glitches, consider using a fixed filter row above the table.

- Resizable Columns:
  Consider saving/restoring column order as well as width.

- Accessibility:
  Ensure color choices are accessible (e.g., for colorblind users).

## 3. Data Handling

- Session File Format:  
  The session file is a CSV with custom section headers. This works, but is brittle. Consider using JSON or a more structured format for session persistence.

- Exclusion/Comment Keying:  
  You use the tuple of row values (excluding Excluded/Comments) as the key for comments. This can break if the row content changes (e.g., after filtering or grouping). Consider using a unique row ID or hash.

- Grouping Logic:  
  The `group_rows` function groups by a tuple of fields. If the row structure changes, this could break. Make sure the grouping keys are always consistent.

## 4. Error Handling

- User Feedback:  
  Most error cases show a QMessageBox, which is good. For long operations, consider also logging errors to the status bar.

- Thread Safety:  
  The worker thread emits signals to update the UI, which is correct. Ensure that all UI updates are done in the main thread.

## 5. Code Quality

- Repeated Code:  
  Thereâ€™s some repeated logic (e.g., for exporting/importing CSVs, updating recent folders). Refactor into reusable functions.
  Some code (e.g., color setting, tooltips) is repeated in multiple places. Consider helper functions.

## 6. User Experience

- Filter Row Usability:
  Consider adding a "Clear All Filters" button.
  Add tooltips to filter boxes explaining supported syntax (e.g., for numeric filters).

- Session File Format:
  Consider using a more robust format (e.g., JSON or SQLite) for session files, especially if you plan to extend features.

- Error Feedback:
  When loading fails (e.g., bad patterns file), consider showing the error in a dedicated error dialog with details and possible fixes.

## 7. Documentation

- User Guide:
  Consider generating a user guide (even as a markdown file) from your features dialog content.

- Developer Guide:
  Document how to add new log patterns, extend the UI, or add new export formats.

# Minor Issues & Typos
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- In `parse_log_file`, the VCS patterns use `$$` in regex, which is not a valid regex syntax. Double-check these patterns.
- In `apply_filters`, the logic for Excluded column is a bit convoluted. Simplify or document.
- In `show_all_comments_for_selected_row`, you only show the comment for the first selected row. Consider showing all selected comments.
- In `show_context_menu`, you add "Show All Comments" but the function only shows for one row.
- In `toggle_dark_mode`, the stylesheet is hardcoded. Consider loading from a file or resource.

# Future Ideas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Tagging System: Allow users to tag log entries for categorization.
- Bulk Commenting: When adding comments, apply them to all rows with the same message.
- Code Refactoring: Once all features are added, split the code into different files for re-use.
- Command Line Interface (CLI): For users who prefer scripting or automation.
- Auto-Triage Suggestions: Use simple heuristics or ML to suggest likely causes or group similar issues.
- Integration Hooks: Allow integration with bug tracking tools (e.g., JIRA) or CI/CD pipelines.
- Plugin System: Allow users to add custom log parsers or visualizations.
- Remote Log Loading: Support loading logs from remote servers.
- Automated Report Generation: Generate PDF/HTML reports from filtered data.
- Compare: Comparision between differnet regressions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Issue in Large file loading
  /home/data/mpu32_simulation/MUSTANG_ST012_A0/simulation_logs/MUSTANG_ST012_A0_HPP_ISS_RTL7_ECO0/RTL_rtl7_eco0_Regression_06_27_2025

- First Error Need some focus
- License issue (Need to take care)
- Downgraded error needs to be removed from the table (by default some .csv will handle it)
- I saved the session, and i have loaded the session. Then i opened the another regressuib folder, but exclusion from previosu was loaded, so whenever i am loading new session, it needs to ignore the exclusion
