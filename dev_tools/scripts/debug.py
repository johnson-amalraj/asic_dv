Building new debugging tools can significantly streamline your verification workflow. Here are some tool ideas specifically for VLSI verification debugging, along with high-level descriptions to get started:

1. Log Analyzer Tool

Objective: Parse and analyze simulator logs to extract meaningful insights.
	•	Features:
	•	Highlight critical errors, warnings, and assertions.
	•	Provide a summary of simulation time, passed/failed checks, and coverage data.
	•	Filter logs based on severity or module names.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Use Python with regex to parse logs.
	•	Include a graphical interface using libraries like Tkinter or a web-based dashboard using Flask.
	•	Generate charts or reports using Matplotlib or Plotly.

Example Starter Code:

import re

def parse_logs(log_file):
    with open(log_file, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    errors = [line for line in lines if "ERROR" in line]
    warnings = [line for line in lines if "WARNING" in line]

    print(f"Total Errors: {len(errors)}")
    print(f"Total Warnings: {len(warnings)}")
    print("\nSample Errors:")
    for error in errors[:5]:
        print(error.strip())

# Use this with a simulator log file
parse_logs('simulation.log')

2. Waveform Navigator

Objective: Help engineers find specific events in waveform dumps (VCD/FST/FSDB files) quickly.
	•	Features:
	•	Search for signal transitions, spikes, or specific patterns.
	•	Highlight time intervals with unexpected behaviors.
	•	Generate screenshots or waveform sections for debugging.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Use open-source libraries like PyVCD for VCD files.
	•	Create a simple GUI for user interaction (e.g., with PyQt).
	•	Integrate with existing waveform viewers if possible.

3. Coverage Debug Tool

Objective: Identify untested areas and root causes of coverage misses.
	•	Features:
	•	Highlight bins with zero coverage.
	•	Map coverage holes to specific sequences or scenarios.
	•	Suggest modifications to test cases to improve coverage.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Parse coverage reports (e.g., XML/JSON format).
	•	Use Python to analyze and visualize coverage data.
	•	Output actionable recommendations for testbench improvements.

Example Integration with JSON Coverage:

import json

def analyze_coverage(coverage_file):
    with open(coverage_file, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)

    for item in data.get("coverage", []):
        if item['hits'] == 0:
            print(f"Uncovered bin: {item['name']} in {item['scope']}")

# Replace 'coverage.json' with your report file
analyze_coverage('coverage.json')

4. Debugging Dashboard for UVM Testbenches

Objective: Visualize real-time or post-simulation data from UVM components.
	•	Features:
	•	Monitor UVM component activity (e.g., transaction count, phase status).
	•	Track configuration values passed through the factory.
	•	View assertion failures in real time.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Modify your UVM testbench to log data into a structured format (e.g., CSV/JSON).
	•	Use a web dashboard framework like Dash or Streamlit to visualize the data.

5. Assertion Failure Tracker

Objective: Pinpoint conditions leading to assertion failures.
	•	Features:
	•	Capture signal states at the time of assertion failures.
	•	Correlate failures to specific test scenarios or sequences.
	•	Provide an easy-to-navigate failure timeline.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Use Python to parse assertion logs and extract signal dump data (e.g., from a VCD file).
	•	Automate email notifications with failure details and suggested fixes.

6. Randomization Debugger

Objective: Investigate and debug constrained-random failures.
	•	Features:
	•	Extract seed information and random values for failed scenarios.
	•	Visualize the constraint-solving process.
	•	Replay or modify seeds for further analysis.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Parse simulator output to capture seeds and random values.
	•	Create a seed-replay mechanism using the same randomization constraints.

Example of Seed Extraction from Logs:

def extract_seed(log_file):
    with open(log_file, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    for line in lines:
        if "SEED" in line:
            print(f"Seed found: {line.strip()}")

extract_seed('simulation.log')

7. Signal State Tracker

Objective: Debug signal state transitions over time for specific scenarios.
	•	Features:
	•	Monitor specific signals and capture their transitions.
	•	Detect and highlight glitches or unexpected behavior.
	•	Export state changes to Excel or CSV for analysis.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Parse waveform dumps (e.g., VCD/FST).
	•	Use Python libraries like Pandas to process and export data.

8. Test Plan Tracker

Objective: Link test scenarios to the test plan and track completion.
	•	Features:
	•	Import a test plan (e.g., Excel/CSV).
	•	Cross-reference test cases with coverage data.
	•	Highlight unimplemented or incomplete tests.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Use Python libraries like openpyxl to read/write Excel files.
	•	Integrate with a coverage tool to correlate test case completion.
