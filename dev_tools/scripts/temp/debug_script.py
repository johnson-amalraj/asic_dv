Building new debugging tools can significantly streamline your verification workflow. Here are some tool ideas specifically for VLSI verification debugging, along with high-level descriptions to get started:

1. Log Analyzer Tool

Objective: Parse and analyze simulator logs to extract meaningful insights.
	•	Features:
	•	Highlight critical errors, warnings, and assertions.
	•	Provide a summary of simulation time, passed/failed checks, and coverage data.
	•	Filter logs based on severity or module names.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Use Python with regex to parse logs.
	•	Include a graphical interface using libraries like Tkinter or a web-based dashboard using Flask.
	•	Generate charts or reports using Matplotlib or Plotly.

Example Starter Code:

import re

def parse_logs(log_file):
    with open(log_file, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    errors = [line for line in lines if "ERROR" in line]
    warnings = [line for line in lines if "WARNING" in line]

    print(f"Total Errors: {len(errors)}")
    print(f"Total Warnings: {len(warnings)}")
    print("\nSample Errors:")
    for error in errors[:5]:
        print(error.strip())

# Use this with a simulator log file
parse_logs('simulation.log')

2. Waveform Navigator

Objective: Help engineers find specific events in waveform dumps (VCD/FST/FSDB files) quickly.
	•	Features:
	•	Search for signal transitions, spikes, or specific patterns.
	•	Highlight time intervals with unexpected behaviors.
	•	Generate screenshots or waveform sections for debugging.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Use open-source libraries like PyVCD for VCD files.
	•	Create a simple GUI for user interaction (e.g., with PyQt).
	•	Integrate with existing waveform viewers if possible.

3. Coverage Debug Tool

Objective: Identify untested areas and root causes of coverage misses.
	•	Features:
	•	Highlight bins with zero coverage.
	•	Map coverage holes to specific sequences or scenarios.
	•	Suggest modifications to test cases to improve coverage.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Parse coverage reports (e.g., XML/JSON format).
	•	Use Python to analyze and visualize coverage data.
	•	Output actionable recommendations for testbench improvements.

Example Integration with JSON Coverage:

import json

def analyze_coverage(coverage_file):
    with open(coverage_file, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)

    for item in data.get("coverage", []):
        if item['hits'] == 0:
            print(f"Uncovered bin: {item['name']} in {item['scope']}")

# Replace 'coverage.json' with your report file
analyze_coverage('coverage.json')

4. Debugging Dashboard for UVM Testbenches

Objective: Visualize real-time or post-simulation data from UVM components.
	•	Features:
	•	Monitor UVM component activity (e.g., transaction count, phase status).
	•	Track configuration values passed through the factory.
	•	View assertion failures in real time.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Modify your UVM testbench to log data into a structured format (e.g., CSV/JSON).
	•	Use a web dashboard framework like Dash or Streamlit to visualize the data.

5. Assertion Failure Tracker

Objective: Pinpoint conditions leading to assertion failures.
	•	Features:
	•	Capture signal states at the time of assertion failures.
	•	Correlate failures to specific test scenarios or sequences.
	•	Provide an easy-to-navigate failure timeline.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Use Python to parse assertion logs and extract signal dump data (e.g., from a VCD file).
	•	Automate email notifications with failure details and suggested fixes.

6. Randomization Debugger

Objective: Investigate and debug constrained-random failures.
	•	Features:
	•	Extract seed information and random values for failed scenarios.
	•	Visualize the constraint-solving process.
	•	Replay or modify seeds for further analysis.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Parse simulator output to capture seeds and random values.
	•	Create a seed-replay mechanism using the same randomization constraints.

Example of Seed Extraction from Logs:

def extract_seed(log_file):
    with open(log_file, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    for line in lines:
        if "SEED" in line:
            print(f"Seed found: {line.strip()}")

extract_seed('simulation.log')

7. Signal State Tracker

Objective: Debug signal state transitions over time for specific scenarios.
	•	Features:
	•	Monitor specific signals and capture their transitions.
	•	Detect and highlight glitches or unexpected behavior.
	•	Export state changes to Excel or CSV for analysis.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Parse waveform dumps (e.g., VCD/FST).
	•	Use Python libraries like Pandas to process and export data.

8. Test Plan Tracker

Objective: Link test scenarios to the test plan and track completion.
	•	Features:
	•	Import a test plan (e.g., Excel/CSV).
	•	Cross-reference test cases with coverage data.
	•	Highlight unimplemented or incomplete tests.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Use Python libraries like openpyxl to read/write Excel files.
	•	Integrate with a coverage tool to correlate test case completion.

Would you like to focus on one of these tools and dive into its implementation? If yes, let me know your preferences!

Here’s a collection of scripts tailored for the 8 suggested tools. These are starter implementations and can be enhanced as needed.

                print(f"Found signal: {signal.name}")
                print(f"Transitions: {len(signal.transitions)}")
                for transition in signal.transitions[:10]:  # Show first 10
                    print(f"Time: {transition.time}, Value: {transition.value}")

    for bin in uncovered_bins:
        print(f"Uncovered bin: {bin['name']} in scope: {bin['scope']}")

analyze_coverage('coverage.json')

4. Debugging Dashboard for UVM Testbenches

import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

# Example data structure
data = {'Component': ['env', 'agent1', 'agent2'],
        'Transactions': [100, 80, 50],
        'Phase': ['run', 'run', 'run']}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

st.title("UVM Debug Dashboard")
st.write("Component Activity Summary")
st.dataframe(df)

5. Assertion Failure Tracker

import re

def track_assertions(log_file):
    with open(log_file, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    for line in lines:
        if "assertion failed" in line.lower():
            print(f"Assertion Failure: {line.strip()}")

track_assertions('simulation.log')

6. Randomization Debugger

def extract_seed(log_file):
    with open(log_file, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    for line in lines:
        if "SEED" in line.upper():
            print(f"Seed Found: {line.strip()}")

extract_seed('simulation.log')

7. Signal State Tracker

import pandas as pd

def track_signal_state(vcd_file, signal_name):
    # Example placeholder - requires actual parsing library for VCD
    data = {'Time': [0, 10, 20, 30], 'Value': ['0', '1', '0', '1']}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    df.to_csv(f'{signal_name}_state.csv', index=False)
    print(f"State changes exported to {signal_name}_state.csv")

track_signal_state('waveform.vcd', 'clk')

8. Test Plan Tracker

import pandas as pd

def track_test_plan(test_plan_file, coverage_file):
    plan = pd.read_excel(test_plan_file)
    coverage = pd.read_csv(coverage_file)

    # Join test plan with coverage data
    merged = plan.merge(coverage, on='TestID', how='left')
    uncovered = merged[merged['Coverage'] < 100]

    print("Uncovered Test Scenarios:")
    print(uncovered)

track_test_plan('test_plan.xlsx', 'coverage_report.csv')

How to Use These Scripts:
	1.	Replace placeholder files (e.g., simulation.log, waveform.vcd) with actual file paths.
	2.	Install required Python libraries:
	•	pip install pyvcd pandas streamlit openpyxl matplotlib plotly
	3.	Run each script separately or integrate them into a larger tool framework.
