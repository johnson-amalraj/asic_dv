Interview Questions:

have 3 class. class A, class B extends A, class C extends B.
now all the class have the method print().
now I call the method super.print() from class C.
now which method will execute whether B or A class method ?

how to disable the error in UVM ?

Tx working some diff frequency and Rx working some other frequency, now how both will communicating each other

Diff b/w reg and logic (clue :  multiple master)

Diff b/w queue and mailbox
Diff b/w assoc array and queue ?
Deep copy explain with example.
Diff b/w `include and import

How to assign the value for transaction class variables from command line?

what are all the compiler directories available ? and its use

In UVM have sequence, sequencer and driver, how all this are synchronizing ?

why we don't prepare mailbox for two block communication instead of seq_item_port and analysis_port in UVM?

what are all the advantages in UVM compare to OVM ?

Details about `include and `define ?

why we use TLM in UVM ?

where you trigger the functional coverage ?

class A, class B, class C. all are have the same method called print().
scenario-1: all class have virtual method, now how to access class B and C methods
scenari-2:
class A, B have virtual methods and B extends from A. how can we access the parent and child class methods
scenario-3:
A is virtual class. class B, C derived from A. now how can we access class B, C methods using virtual concept.

how to generate clock for 10MHz frequency ?

why class are dynamic?

having memory block with 100 locations, need to do more number of read and write, how to write constraint for this?

If i am not doing cross coverage b/w two cover points, what functioonality may be i will miss.

having many number of different sequences, how to select and run the particular sequence?

Using the set_config_db, I will set value for X. intest case x=1, from env x=2, from agent x = 3, now I am using get_config_db method, what value can I get now ?

details about, how scoreboard get data from monitor?

why we prepare mailbox for communicating between two threads?

when simulation gets hanging ? now, what can we do ?

In an RTL has 2 i/p and 1 o/p pins, now how many monitors need to be implement and how many scoreboard need to implement?

what is TLM fifo ?

what are all the ports available in UVM and explain about it?

Diff b/w polymorphism and inheritance ? and example.

concept about raise_objection and drop_objection?

how to access and change the port driven value from test case?

If we have one sequence and 4 sequencers, how to virtual sequencer process this sequence with correct sequencer? what basics it will select that particular sequencer?

how to write an sequence, it will trigger in another sequence for SoC level verification?

who start the sequence?

what is mean by reuseability in UVm explain with proper example?

having 2 DUT and 2 TB, they are connecting togather, now what are all components we can reuse it?

now driver processing one thread, before completing this the drive ask next item from sequencer. now what is behaviour of TB in UVM ?

having 1024 memory address, who to verify whether all the locations are accessed or not ?

what are all the types of overriding ? what basics we use this two types of overriding?

what is the need of BFM in Sv?

write an constraint for 2,4,8,16,32.... like this order?
