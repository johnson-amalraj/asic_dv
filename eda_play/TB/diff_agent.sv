Yes, it is possible to run different agents connected back-to-back in Icarus Verilog. You can define each agent as a separate module in SystemVerilog and instantiate them in the top-level testbench module.

Here's an example of how to instantiate two agents and connect them back-to-back in Icarus Verilog:

java
Copy code
// Agent 1 module definition
module agent1 (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input [7:0] data_in,
  output [7:0] data_out
);
  // Agent 1 implementation code here
endmodule

// Agent 2 module definition
module agent2 (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input [7:0] data_in,
  output [7:0] data_out
);
  // Agent 2 implementation code here
endmodule

// Top-level testbench module
module top;
  // Instantiate agents
  agent1 a1(clk, reset, data1_out, data2_in);
  agent2 a2(clk, reset, data2_out, data1_in);
  
  // Define clock and reset signals
  reg clk = 0;
  reg reset = 1;
  
  // Connect clock and reset signals to agents
  always #5 clk = ~clk;
  always #20 reset = 0;

  // Connect data signals between agents
  wire [7:0] data1_out;
  wire [7:0] data1_in;
  wire [7:0] data2_out;
  wire [7:0] data2_in;
  assign data1_out = a1.data_out;
  assign data2_in = a1.data_out;
  assign data2_out = a2.data_out;
  assign data1_in = a2.data_out;
  
  // Testbench code here
endmodule
In the above example, we define two agent modules agent1 and agent2, which have inputs for clock, reset, and data, and outputs for data. We then instantiate these modules in the top-level top module and connect their input and output signals. Finally, we define the clock and reset signals and connect them to the agents.

You can then write your testbench code inside the top module to interact with the agents and verify their behavior. Once you have written your code, you can compile and run it using Icarus Verilog.

To compile and run the above setup using Icarus Verilog, you can use the following commands:

Compile the Verilog files and create an executable:
Copy code
iverilog -o tb_file.vvp top_file.sv env_file.sv agent_file.sv driver_file.sv bfm_file.sv
Run the executable:
Copy code
vvp tb_file.vvp
This will run the simulation and execute the testbench code, which interacts with the DUT (design under test) through the agent and driver, and verifies the output using the BFM.

Note that the actual file names will depend on the names you have used for your files. The iverilog command compiles all the Verilog files and creates an executable file named tb_file.vvp. You can then run this executable using the vvp command to execute the simulation.
